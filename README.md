# Food Flingin'

### Purdue Univeristy CS390VR Final Project

You’re a master chef at an open-roof restaurant and are too lazy to move around the kitchen. You decide it would be a great idea to throw all your ingredients across the kitchen and into your cooking pots. You don’t want your customers to wait long, so you must finish all your recipes as fast as possible!
